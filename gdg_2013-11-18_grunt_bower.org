Setting up new applications is byzantine for new users.

   :END:

- rails 
- lein new {template}

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir my-chrome-app 
cd my-chrome-app
yo chromeapp:app my-chrome-app
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Gruntfile.js app          bower.json   dist         node_modules package.json test
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Grunt builds your projects 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
   :END:

- make 
- rake 
- ant 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grunt
#+END_SRC

* Bower manages your dependency
   :PROPERTIES:
   :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
   :END:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bower install angular --save-dev
#+END_SRC
pulls down dependencies 
http://bower.io/

- ivy 
- maven 
- pip 

* AngularJS Example

** Yeoman

We're going to go through the setup of a Chrome Application for
pulling down a gallery locally from Flickr. 

* Chrome App Example 
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:

- Local install only where we want help with CRX packaging 
- Cover the standard case of a new application and also the update
  story 
- Ensure integration into existing stacks is notes 

* JavaScript Tools
  :PROPERTIES:
  :slide:    slide
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
  :END:

- consistency of style 
- compile on watch 
- static builds 
- shell script 
- css preprocessors

These all feed into the lifestyle of projects in JavaScript. 

* Updating
  :PROPERTIES:
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
  :END:

Updating versions of components is trivial. Regression testing 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm update -g generator-chromeapp
#+END_SRC

* Searching

- npm searching 
- Grunt.js search on github 

* Installation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
  :END:

Starting with a clean installation.

  Alman) http://benalman.com/news/2012/03/introducing-grunt/
- April 2012 Grunt and Yeoman as a tools tracks at JSConf (both Irish and Alman ) http://2012.jsconf.us/ 
- June 2012 Grunt on a session for http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/
- June 2012 Yeoman releases at Google I/O
  groups and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk-tFn2Ix6g

* Grunt plugins

The story for adding in new features 

* Package Privacy 

 locally for project

bower register <my-package-name> <git-endpoint>

* Friction 

Version control  and submodule access 

Public access for components when using client visible changes of the
minified files. 
* Conclusion

- Useful in single page applications 

- Still very young 

* Questions?
