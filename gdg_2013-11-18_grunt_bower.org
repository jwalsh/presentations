- Why do the tools exist 
- What do they do 
- How can you use 
- When would you want to use 

* What

Simplify workflow for JavaScript applications. Best example are the notes in:

Setting up new applications is byzantine for new users. 

* Equivalence

- Butlers maintains your house.  
- Warthogs provide manual work. 
- Birds maintain your nest. 

** Yeoman

- rails 
- lein new {template}

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir my-chrome-app && cd my-chrome-app
yo chromeapp:app my-chrome-app
#+END_SRC

** Grunt

- make 
- rake 
- ant 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grunt
#+END_SRC

** Bower

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bower install angular --save-dev
#+END_SRC
pulls down dependencies 
http://bower.io/

- ivy 
- maven 
- pip 

* AngularJS Example

We're going to go through the setup of a Chrome Application for
pulling down a gallery locally from Flickr. 

* Updating

Updating versions of components is trivial. Regression testing 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm update -g generator-chromeapp
#+END_SRC

* Chrome App Example 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
  :END:

- Local install only where we want help with CRX packaging 
- Cover the standard case of a new application and also the update
  story 
- Ensure integration into existing stacks is notes 

* Installation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
  :END:

Starting with a clean installation.  

* JavaScript Tools
  :PROPERTIES:
  :slide:    slide
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
  :END:

- consistency of style 
- compile on watch 
- static builds 
- shell script 
- css preprocessors

These all feed into the lifestyle of projects in JavaScript.

This is broadly the history of all JavaScript Tooling: 



- 2011: Static analysis 
- JSLint 
- February 2011: JSHint http://badassjs.com/post/3364925033/jshint-an-community-driven-fork-of-jslint
- March 2012 Grunt releases with init and basic task support (Ben
  Alman) http://benalman.com/news/2012/03/introducing-grunt/
- April 2012 Grunt and Yeoman as a tools tracks at JSConf (both Irish and Alman ) http://2012.jsconf.us/ 
- June 2012 Grunt on a session for http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/
- June 2012 Yeoman releases at Google I/O
  groups and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk-tFn2Ix6g
- November 2012 first public Bower release at 0.5 from Twitter 
- February 2013: Grunt 0.4 adds local checkout  

* Grunt plugins

The story for adding in new features 

* Package Privacy 

 locally for project

bower register <my-package-name> <git-endpoint>

* Friction 

Version control  and submodule access 

Public access for components when using client visible changes of the
minified files. 
* Conclusion

- Useful in single page applications 

- Still very young 

* Questions?
